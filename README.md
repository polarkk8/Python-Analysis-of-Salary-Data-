# Python-Analysis-of-Salary-Data-Pet Project
Salary Prediction Analysis: Experience vs. Compensation

This project analyzes the relationship between years of experience and salary using linear regression. The dataset contains 30 observations with two variables: YearsExperience and Salary.

Project Highlights:

 - Exploratory Data Analysis: Distribution analysis, correlation calculations, outlier detection

 - Visualization: Scatter plots, histograms, box plots, regression lines

 - Modeling: Linear regression with statistical validation

 - Insights: Salary growth patterns, prediction intervals, key metrics

Findings:

 - Strong positive correlation (r > 0.98) between experience and salary

 - Linear model explains ~95% of salary variance

 - Predictable salary progression with increasing experience

Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels
